Algorithm
    Step by step procedure to solve a problem
    a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations

complexity (Computational complexity)


time complexity
    In computer science, the time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string representing the input.
    The time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed using big O notation, which excludes coefficients and lower order terms.
    When expressed this way, the time complexity is said to be described asymptotically, i.e., as the input size goes to infinity.
    For example, if the time required by an algorithm on all inputs of size n is at most 5n3 + 3n for any n (bigger than some n0), the asymptotic time complexity is O(n3).

memory complexity
    Memory complexity is the size of work memory used by an algorithm.

best-case complexity
    This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size n.

worst case complexity
    This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size n

average case complexity
    This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average.
    This complexity is only defined with respect to a probability distribution over the inputs.
    For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear,
    the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size n.
